# Prop Hunt

# Soon for 2023.3.28

A mod for [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) which adds a completely new gamemode, Prop Hunt!


## How To Play
Prop Hunt replaces the default roles in the game with two new roles, the **Seekers** and the **Props**.

**Props**: The goal of the props is to do all of their tasks while hiding from the Seekers by disguising as tasks. When a prop is killed, they join the Seeker team and must hunt the other props.

**Seekers**: The goal of the seekers is to find and kill all props. At the beginning of the game, the Seekers are locked in place while the Props hide. When they are released, the Seekers get a limited number of attempts to kill people, and if they exceed it, they die.

## Controls
| Key | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `R` | Clone nearest task |
| `Shift` | Noclip through walls |

*Note: Noclip is a temporary solution for getting stuck, not for hiding!*

## Default Settings
| Settings | Effect | Default |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Hiding Time | The amount of time that the Props get to hide | 30 |
| Max Missed Kills | The number of attempts that the Seekers get to kill the props | 3 |
| Infection Mode | Whether Props become Seekers when they are killed | True |

## Installation
Download the zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/Wael1231/PropHunt-Reactivited/releases), and extract the contents into your Among Us game folder.

Although the mod *may* work on official servers, it is highly discouraged to do so, and will likely get you banned. Instead, try to setup your own modded server using [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) or another Reactor compatible server.

## Compatability
Prop Hunt is fully compatible with [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged)!

# Note : Submerged Soon will release an update next week for Among us 2023.6.13
However, Prop Hunt will **not** work with many other mods, such as role mods and any other mod which modifies the gameplay loop.

Maybe Working for support TownOfModrole mod (Mod came in future);
